## Evaluation
“Robots Reading Vogue” is a project created by the Digital Humanities Lab and Haas Arts Library of Yale University to demonstrate the capabilities of using digital tools and methodologies to analyze over 2700 covers and 400,000 pages of Vogue Magazine. Experimenting with digital humanities tools like topic modeling, n-grams, and color analysis, Yale students and faculty tried to answer questions ranging from gender studies to computer science.

One project that I looked at specifically was “Using temporal word embeddings to reveal the shifting notion of beauty in Vogue” by Sydney Bowe. This project traces shifts in the meaning of the word “beauty” over two centuries, looking at how different historical periods discuss beauty. The technologies involved in this specific project are word embedding algorithms, Word2Vec, which “uses a thin two-layered neural network to ‘place’ words in multi-dimensional space.” By looking at words neighboring the word “beauty” in magazine articles, this project reveals underlying societal associations with beauty and any shifts that have occurred over time.

One major strength of the project is that it’s very easy to understand and accessible to readers who might not be familiar with digital humanities or word embeddings at all. It includes short and concise summaries of the connotations of beauty at each time, which allows even readers who aren’t familiar with dendrograms to understand the trends at a glance. It also has a bird’s eyes view map of all the changes at the end. I think another strength is the concept itself, since it does make sense that societal perceptions of beauty can be best objectively understood by its neighboring words and ideas. I also liked the 2D map that allows for more user interaction and engagement. And lastly, I think the entire project is displayed in an artistic, aesthetically pleasing way. There’s a visual flair that draws readers and it doesn’t overcrowd information. The design helps to present the information extremely effectively in a way that captivates the reader. 

The project could be improved by drawing from more sources to get information about beauty not only in Vogue, but perhaps also in journalistic sources like the New York Times, to create a larger scope of view. It could also be improved by using more intuitive forms of graphs than dendrograms, since I think most people don’t know what dendrograms are and would have to put extra effort into understanding them. Word clouds might be a more intuitive alternative, as long as it doesn’t erase any important data in the process.
