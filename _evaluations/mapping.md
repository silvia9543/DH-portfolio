## Evaluation
"Mapping Inequality: Redlining in New Deal America" is a digital map that is color-coded and filled with area descriptions and information that allows users to easily identify historically 
red-lined areas. According to the project web page, this tool was originally created through the collaboration of three teams at four universities: The University of Richmond, Virginia Tech, 
University of Maryland, and John Hopkins University. 

The map's code shows areas of the US that were graded, with green representing "Best", blue representing "Still Desirable", yellow representing "Definitely Declining", and red representing 
"Hazardous". The size of the circles on the map represents the area that HOLC graded, and users can click on any area in the map to see a scan of the areas by grade and the demographics of the area. Users can even pinpoint specific neighborhoods to get the description and characteristics of the area, including the cost of living, appearance of the neighborhood, close-by perks, age of structures, and more. Users can also see details about the population, such as class, occupation, and nationalities. 

As a working example, I clicked on Sioux City, IA and was able to see that a whopping 73% of it was rated a D, "Hazardous", and most of the area is colored red. In contrast, only 4% of it is rated A, "Best". When I click on some of the red areas, I learn that the land is rough and hilly, taxes are high, no modern homes, and difficult to sell. The sentence that stood out to me in its description was "There is no future in this section for the next 20 years." Curious to know whether these descriptions came from the project creators themselves or the HOLC, I did some research and it seems that they came from the National Archives. 

This tool may have a good use case for historians, sociologists, anthropologists, and politicians who want to look at red-lining at a national scale to try and identify any general patterns or trends, see which communities have been most affected by discriminative policies, and which areas are void of resources that could use more funding. This tool does not draw any interpretation of the data, but rather just displays the data for the user to use for themselves, which is one limit of the tool. 

The tool uses technologies like the development of a NYPL Scribe-enhanced crowdsourcing platform, design and testing of database models, data cleaning, and georeferencing of historical maps according to the webpage.

A strength of this tool is that it's very user-friendly and provides really helpful visualization of a big and difficult phenomenon to track down. There is no additional software the user has to download or code to write. It also was transcribed well, since all of the content is easy to read and understand, and accessible in general. Although since this is all historical data, it may be a bit difficult to see present-day relevance for the average user. Having some kind of way to monitor the state of present-day land would be a really cool improvement to see, but would definitely be a big task that might be outside the scope of the tool's goal. Overall, it is a really helpful visualization of red-lining and provides informative descriptions of affected areas.
