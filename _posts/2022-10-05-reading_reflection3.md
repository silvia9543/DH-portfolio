“Beyond Translation: Language Hacking and Philology” by Gregory Crane brings up many interesting issues related to the field of digital humanities, such as how data science and/or machine learning can bolster intellectual activity around humanities materials. He raises the problems of how readers engage with sources in languages and cultures that are not their own, the consequences of digitized reading, and how digital tools are shifting participation in specialized topics. 

One consequence that Crane discusses is how digital-based modes of reading have normalized skim reading and how deep reading cognitive processes are under threat as digital-based modes of reading become more popular. Another important idea that he brings up is how automated translation has opened ways of interacting with sources in foreign languages. Since translation has traditionally been done by humans, machine translations allow much more text to be translated and therefore grants greater access to them, so that readers without knowledge of the original language may use these translations. Rather than translation being a final product, machines have turned it into a starting point for further exploration. The machine translations also make readers more aware that translation often hides and distorts meaning, since human-translated texts often adapt the translation to meaning. 

Crane also discusses smart texts, which are texts that combine features to support readers from a range of cultural and linguistic backgrounds. These features include annotations, functionality that shows word and phrase alignments of translated texts to their original sources, commentaries about specific passages and more. 

Crane also highlights a few suggestions that he has for the digital humanities community. The first is to improve quality assurance of results produced by digital tools, especially in communities that are open to anyone. He makes an important observation about how digital humanities have shifted participation in humanities analysis, from a small group of specialists making judgements to a larger republic of people who can contribute. Because of digital tools, the process of participating in humanities research has been democratized a little bit. 

A few questions that this reading inspired me to ask are: Do machine translations of text show a reduction in quality from human translations, and how does that affect interpretations? Is the democratization of humanities research overall good, or does it lead to inaccurate and widely differing conclusions? Where do you foresee computing taking away or adding to human analyses in the future?
