In “The Collaborative Musical Text,” Freedman, Vigilanti, and Crandell emphasize the collaborative nature of digital humanities projects, especially in the field of musicology. They discuss their own projects, such as a digital archive of sixteenth-century French music and The Lost Voices project, which reconstructs about 120 lost pieces. A few salient ideas are the importance of open-source standards, clear systems of documentation, considering the needs of users, and establishing social frameworks in collaborative works to make digital humanities projects successful and maintainable. 

In their Lost Voices project, which incorporated high open-source standards and clear documentation systems, the authors worked together to design a system to dynamically render musical notation and display alternation versions of the reconstructed voices. They also created digital spaces for users to take their own notes on the music and participate in public discussions of it too. This project has since been used as both a research and teaching tool spanning North America and Europe. From this project, the authors have been able to extend their research to create other projects. 

The authors discuss the digitalization of musical scores and how the sight of a computer on a music stand is becoming quite common. They say that there is no “best” way to represent music, whether it’s a sound recording or a graphical script, so the key thing to remember is that contributors need to listen to each other carefully to make decisions that will not pose problems for their work later on. By articulating their research questions and goals, they can share their knowledge and work together in a way that does not impede each other.

Lastly, the reading stresses the importance of knowing the user, aka who the project is intended to benefit. This helps the team decide on key functions early on to shape the user experience. The earlier the better, since there often exist constraints of time and money, which force them to prioritize goals. 

A few questions that this reading brings up are the impact of the digitalization of music – does it allow more people to participate in the creation and analysis of classical scores? Does it make music more disposable because it’s more easily accessible? Another question I have concerns the biggest challenges of digitizing music, particularly the notation since it can be rather abstract. What technologies are used to deal with reading music online?
