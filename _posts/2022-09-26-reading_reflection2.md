In “An Overview of The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire”, J.G.A. Pocock discusses the six-volume work “The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire” by English historian Edward Gibbon, which discusses Western civilization from the Roman Empire’s reign to the fall of Byzantium. He discusses how Gibbon’s first three volumes tells the story of Rome’s eventual loss of military and civic power, until it was taken over by “barbarian mercenaries recruited to fill the vacuum left by the failure of Rome to defend itself”. Pocock explains how this narrative survived to the end of Gibbon’s first trilogy and became an important self-criticism of a “modern understanding of empire and society”. He also talks about how Gibbon’s work uses an overarching grand narrative of the history of religion, which outweighs all other narratives. 

Pocock also discusses his two strategies for studying Gibbon’s Barbarism and Religion. His first strategy was contextual, analyzing the way that Gibbon’s narratives evolved, and the themes of imperial decay, barbarism, and religion that weaved through them. The second was contextual in a different sense, that studied the different historians around his time who also participated in the historiographical culture of the eighteenth century. He also raises challenges that Gibbons may have faced in writing, namely the challenge of deciding how a history of over a thousand years was to be written, and even whether it was worth writing at all. 

Questions that this reading raises include Gibbon’s true intentions of offering additional chapters in 1776, concluding that we do not know according to present day research and interpretation. Another question concerns the lack of connection between Volume VI and the last three chapters, which also do not sufficiently recognize Eurasian history. Pocock concludes that based on his analysis of Gibbon’s works, there is not always a connection that links one narrative to the next, and perhaps the grandeur of Gibbon’s style as he moves from one narrative to the next is what gives it unity instead.
