“Technology is Taking Over English Departments” by Adam Kirsch strongly disagrees with the use of digital technologies to analyze humanistic materials. One of his main points is that digital humanities is “a field suffering an identity crisis,” which Kirsch backs up by saying that it’s a field that comprises a wide range of activities with “little relationship with another”. Another issue that Kirsch raises is that digital tools are unable to generate new ideas the way that humans can in studying the humanities. He argues that while they are good at finding patterns and aggregating data, they cannot ask questions or raise discussion points about the patterns that they’ve found. One example that he uses is the Google Ngram Viewer, which is an online tool that maps the frequency of words in all the printed matter digitized by Google. 

He asks the question “Does the digital component of digital humanities give us new ways to think, or only ways to illustrate what we already know?”. From his perspective, the only people who can come up with these important questions and ideas are scholars who are well-versed in literature. He believes that computers and algorithms are inherently opposite to the experience and thought that constitutes a humanistic education. 

A few questions that this reading urges me to ask are whether Kirsch believes that computers can be incorporated in any capacity to aid humanities studies, even if they don’t fulfill all of the roles needed. I’d also ask what he thinks about how digital humanities could democratize humanistic studies, allowing anyone to contribute rather than just studied specialists. He mentions this briefly in the reading, but does not flesh out his full take on it, and whether he thinks that this is good for the field.
