In “Why visual literacy is essential to good data visualization,” Cooley defines visual literacy and discusses why it is important in creating accessible and powerful data visualizations. The salient ideas are how visual literacy is separate from data literacy, how data visualizations should cater to the target audience, and how data visualizations should strike a balance in the spectrum of truth and beauty. 

Cooley explains that visual literacy is different from data literacy, which means understanding the data itself. Visual literacy allows you to convey information in a way that is intellectually stimulating and aesthetically compelling – it joins the notes to make music, where the notes represent raw data. Visual literacy is how you present the information, rather than the information itself. 

Cooley discusses the spectrum of truth and beauty. At the extreme left is truth, which is the raw numbers and data. At the extreme right is beauty, which is the most aesthetically pleasing presentation of the data. Of course, a good data visualization cannot lack one or the other, but must strike a balance between visual aesthetic and efficiency at communicating data. He raises the questions that you must ask to create any good data visualization, such as is the chart visually interesting enough? And will readers want to interact with the chart? Without these questions, it’s easy to create a chart that most eyes will glaze over. In this way, good data visualizations should have its target audience in mind when being made.

A few questions that this reading brings up for me are: What are the most common mistakes in creating data visualizations? I’d be curious to know if there are any obvious red flags of data visualizations, such as 3D pie charts. Another one that I have is how important is color in data visualizations? Are there any psychological effects that color has that helps us absorb information better?
